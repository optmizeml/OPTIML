# 🤖 OptiML — Intelligent Desktop Automation (Teaser)

**The AI assistant that actually *does* things on your computer.**  
Voice-first, executes tasks immediately, learns your routines, and automates through **UI-only interactions** — just like a power user would.

## 🚀 What OptiML Does
- **Do-it-now automation.** “Send a recap to the team”, “Organize my downloads”, “Create a monthly expenses sheet”… and it happens.
- **Learns your routines.** Spots patterns you repeat and offers to run them for you (with confirmations).
- **Works where you work.** Files, web email, spreadsheets, dashboards — no plugins required.
- **Local-first.** Runs on your machine with privacy-first defaults.

---

## ✨ Why It’s Different
- **UI-only approach.** OptiML clicks, types, and navigates apps the way you do—no product API hookups.
- **Safety-first.** The **Invisible Security Layer (ISL)** adds confirmation gates for high-risk actions (delete, transfers, system power).
- **Voice-first UX.** Say what you want; OptiML plans it and executes, then shows clear verification.

> **Note:** Use automation responsibly and in line with each app or website’s Terms of Service.

## 🧭 Example Use Cases
- “Draft a status email and attach this week’s report.”
- “Sort my Desktop into folders and archive the screenshots.”
- “Open my project dashboard and capture a quick summary into a spreadsheet.”

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Privacy
- **Guardrails on by default.** High-risk tasks require explicit confirmation.
- **No product API connections.** OptiML operates through the user interface.
- **Your data stays on your device.** Cloud features (if any) are optional and off by default.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap
- **Alpha:** Core desktop automation, safety gates, routine learning (shadow → confirm).
- **Beta:** Voice-first flows, richer dashboard, cross-workflow chaining.
- **1.0:** Team sharing, policy controls, packaged desktop app with auto-updates.
- **Planned:** macOS & Linux support.
